Numpy1:

data type is written as dtype= 'int32' where 32 is the bit size or direct by np.int8.
random array, randint, randn
Array is studied in vectorized form which is in dimensional form, dimension has a part that is axes
On this axis when a plane is drawn and a line traverse through it.
Array is 1D vector.
The elemnts in vector are defined by 'shape'
1D is in the form (3,) if array is ([1,2,3])
array... is called vector
matrix... is called tensor
Matrix is multidimensional array.
np.array([[],[]]), each [] is row
np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[3,4,5]]), each number in row is column like [1,2,3]
zeroD is scalar which has zero dim.
a = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3), reshape is to make diemsion of your choice of vector like for 12 it can be 4,3 3,4 6,2 ,2,6 etc
mirror operation: multipliactiona add, sub, division
